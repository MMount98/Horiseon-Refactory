# Horiseon-Refactory (Module 1 Challenge)

## Purpose/Goal 
  To take the given code and focus on Refoctoring the HTML to include Semantic Elements and organize the CSS style sheet to be set in a logical order of what is displayed on the page itself. It also is meant to test my ability to create an optimized codebase that is in line with the Accessibility Standards set in place. This is to provide a real-world example of what might be given as a possible task when working on project with a team, as well as to test my understanding of what Semantic Elements in HTML will look like when applied. 
  
 ## User Story
  The given User Story is as follows:
    
    AS A marketing agency
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
    
  ## Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
      * WHEN I view the source code
        THEN I find semantic HTML elements
      * WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
        THEN I find that the elements follow a logical 
        structure independent of styling and positioning
      * WHEN I view the image elements
        THEN I find accessible alt attributes
      * WHEN I view the heading attributes
        THEN they fall in sequential order
      * WHEN I view the title element
        THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Challenges

 This project tested something new too me as a developer, Refactoring code. I found that it was harder than I thought when I first started working on this assignment. As I was use to using 'DIV' and 'Class Elements' to add styling to my webpage prior to starting this course. I felt it was a good barrier to work through as I can now see that using Semantic Elements can make ones codebase apper easier to read and write going foward. I found that the best way to refactor the codebase was to use a split pane in my VSCODE and Collapse all the sections in the HTML index and CSS stylesheet. Then only un-collapsing the section I was work on in both documents to clearly see what I was working on at any given time.
